# Declaration

d2r-mapview anti-detection version, this version is modified from https://github.com/joffreybesos/d2-mapserver
The original author has all rights.
Users use it at their own risk.

Running from source code or using AHK-compiled version cannot guarantee security, and you need to pack it by yourself to ensure security. Improper use will lead to failure of anti-detection.
There is no guarantee that it will not be detected.

In this version, the following enhancements have been made to enhance the probability that d2r-mapview may be detected:

1. Remove sensitive substrings from text files and window title.
2. Unlock the font files from AHK self-release, which is convenient to protect these files by packing.
3. Modify localization.ini and release it as a random file to prevent detection.
4. Some other small fix and improvement.

It is strongly recommended that users use VMprotect or other more complex encryption shells to pack the compiled files before use.

# Howto

1. Checkout code.
2. Compile script d2r-map.ahk to d2r-map.exe by AHK2EXE
3. Pack/encrypt d2r-map.exe by your own's packer/shell. Recommand VMprotect, it can add font files to memory to avoid detectation.
4. Change d2r-map.exe to other names and put it to a independent path without sensitive word.
5. Don't run it with bnet client together.
6. Don't run it with windows mapserver. Set your map server on another device/VM.
7. Good luck.

# Q&A

Why not support compiled and packed binary directly?

Any published file can calculate its own MD5 and name, and checking if a known process is running couldn't be easier. It doesn't make any sense to provide binary files directly, compile and package your own executable files, and ensure your own security.

What about noob users?

Don't use this.

# Diablo 2: Resurrected map viewer

Noob friendly FREE map overlay tool for Diablo 2 Resurrected.  
Use at your own risk, there is no warranty or responsibility taken for being penalised for using this.

This tool is licenced under GPLv3, reselling this maphack violates the terms of the license.

## Bans

Blizzard did a ban wave on June 14 where it seems they targeted MapAssist (another map hack).  
This map hack is very similar in how it functions.  
While most users of this map hack were spared, **it is recommended to consider this map hack detectable online**.

## Setup

Set up guide has moved to the wiki:
https://github.com/joffreybesos/d2r-mapview/wiki/Setup-guide

- Press Ctrl+H in game for a help menu
- Press Ctrl+O for in game options

The executable does _not_ require administrator privileges unless you are running the game as administrator. Refer to troubleshooting below if you have issues.  
Sometimes windows defender can intercept the download, try a different browser if this happens.

### Virustotal gave me an alert

The compiled executable will get false positives in virus scans. This is because the tool is written in Autohotkey.
Autohotkey, while a powerful tool, has been used for all sorts of nefarious applications in the past.  
If you look on the Autohotkey forums, you'll see this is a widely reported problem.
This tool reads from memory and hooks into global hotkeys which as a general throws up flags in certain virus scanners.

If you still don't trust it, you can run directly from source which is very easy.
To do so download and install <https://www.autohotkey.com/>  
Then you can simply double click the file `src/d2r-map.ahk` to run from source code.
This way you can be fully aware of what code you're executing and you don't have to trust an opaque executable.

Do not accept executables for this from any other source!

### Usage

Start D2R, then start the MH, you should see text in the top left corner.

- Press `Ctrl+H` to see help in game, including a map legend

## Is it safe?

No one can say for sure. Blizzard do have Warden anti-cheat that will scan your computer for running processes and compare them against a blacklist. I accept no responsibility for any outcomes or usage of this tool. Use at your own risk!
